##  answers

1. What is NumPy?

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a Python library used for fast numerical computation using N-dimensional arrays.

2. What is an ndarray?

ndarray is NumPy’s main data structure — an N-dimensional, homogeneous, fast, memory-efficient array.

3. Difference between Python list and NumPy array?
Python List	NumPy Array
Slower	Very fast (C backend)
Stores mixed data types	Stores same data type
No vectorization	Fully vectorized
More memory usage	Less memory usage

4. How to create a NumPy array?
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])

5. What is dtype?

dtype represents the data type (int32, float64, etc.) of elements stored in ndarray.

6. How to check shape, size, dimensions?
arr.shape   # rows, columns
arr.size    # total elements
arr.ndim    # number of dimensions

7. What is vectorization?

Performing operations on arrays without loops, using optimized C routines.
Example:

a + 10      # vectorized

8. What are zeros(), ones(), arange(), linspace()?

zeros() → array of 0

ones() → array of 1

arange() → values with step size

linspace() → values evenly spaced between two numbers

9. What is the difference between arange() and range()?

range() → Python, returns list-like object

arange() → NumPy, returns ndarray and supports floats

10. What is broadcasting?

Automatic expansion of smaller array to match the shape of larger array during operations.

11. What is itemsize?

Number of bytes each element in the array occupies.

12. How to convert list to array?
np.array(my_list)

13. What is slicing in NumPy?

Extracting parts of array:

arr[1:4]
arr[:, 1]

14. What is indexing in NumPy?

Accessing elements by position:

arr[0]       # first element

15. How to reverse a NumPy array?
arr[::-1]

🔹 Intermediate Level Answers
16. What is reshape()?

Changes the shape of an array without changing data.

17. Difference between reshape() and resize()?
reshape()	resize()
Returns new array	Modifies original array
Fails if size mismatch	Fills with 0/repeats

18. What are flatten() and ravel()?
flatten()	ravel()
Returns a copy	Returns a view
Slower	Faster

19. What is view vs copy?

view → shares memory

copy → new memory
Modifying a view affects original.

20. How to concatenate arrays?
np.concatenate([a, b])

21. Difference between hstack() and vstack()?

hstack() → horizontal (columns)

vstack() → vertical (rows)

22. How to filter values using boolean indexing?
arr[arr > 10]

23. How to find unique values?
np.unique(arr)

24. How to detect NaN values?
np.isnan(arr)

25. How to replace NaN values?
np.nan_to_num(arr)

26. What is axis in NumPy functions?

Axis specifies direction of operation:

axis=0 → column-wise

axis=1 → row-wise

27. What are universal functions (ufuncs)?

Fast vectorized mathematical functions:
np.add, np.sqrt, np.exp, np.sin, etc.

28. What is np.where()?

Conditional selection:

np.where(arr > 5, 1, 0)

29. What is np.argmax(), np.argmin()?

argmax() → index of max value

argmin() → index of min value

30. Difference between np.sum() and Python sum()?

np.sum() is faster, works on N-dimensional arrays.

Python sum() works only on iterables.

🔹 Advanced Level Answers

31. What are strides?

Number of bytes to move in memory to the next element along each axis.

32. Explain memory layout (C-order vs F-order).

C-order (row major): last axis changes fastest

F-order (column major): first axis changes fastest

33. What is broadcasting rule?

Two dimensions are compatible if:

they are equal, or

either is 1

34. What is np.vectorize()?

Wrapper to apply a Python function element-wise (not true vectorization).

35. What is np.random and where used?

Module for generating random numbers (ML, simulations, sampling).

36. What is dot product and matrix multiplication?

Dot → a.b

Matrix multiplication → A @ B

37. What is np.einsum()?

Einstein summation — used for optimized matrix operations and tensor operations.

38. Difference between np.dot() and np.matmul()?

matmul() supports matrix multiplication rules

dot() works for vectors and 1D cases also

39. What are structured arrays?

Arrays with different data types per column (like SQL table or Pandas).

40. What is memory-mapping?

Loading large arrays from disk without fully loading into RAM.

41. What is ndim?

Returns number of array dimensions.

42. What is np.squeeze()?

Removes axes of length 1.

43. What is np.expand_dims()?

Adds a new axis (used for CNN, batch dimension).

44. What is tile() and repeat()?

tile() → repeat whole array

repeat() → repeat each element

45. What is meshgrid()?

Creates coordinate matrices for 2D/3D plotting.

46. What is advanced indexing?

Indexing with arrays/lists instead of scalars.

47. What are fancy indexing rules?

Fancy indexing always returns a copy, not a view.

48. Explain broadcasting with example.
[1,2,3] + 5   → [6,7,8]

49. Difference between copy() and deepcopy()?

copy() → shallow copy

deepcopy() → copies nested objects recursively

50. How to save and load arrays?
np.save('a.npy', arr)
np.load('a.npy')

51. What is np.genfromtxt()?

Reads data from CSV/text files, handling missing values.

52. What is np.percentile()?

Computes percentile values (used in outlier detection).

53. What is np.histogram()?

Returns histogram counts and bin edges.

54. What is np.pad()?

Adds padding around array.

55. What is np.sort() vs np.argsort()?

sort() → sorted array

argsort() → indices of sorted order

56. What is np.trace()?

Sum of diagonal of matrix.

57. What is np.linalg.inv()?

Returns inverse of matrix.

58. What is np.linalg.det()?

Returns determinant of matrix.

59. What is np.linalg.eig()?

Returns eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

60. What is a masked array?

Array that hides (masks) certain values — useful for missing or invalid data.
